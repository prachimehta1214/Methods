*Unary & Binary Operators*
Mathematically, an operation is a calculation on one or more values called operands mapping to an output value. An operator is a symbol/sign that maps operands to output values.  

** A unary operator is one that takes a single operand/argument and performs an operation.*
  * Unary plus (+):	Tries to convert the operand into a number
  * Unary negation (-):	Tries to convert the operand into a number and negates after
  * Logical Not (!):	Converts to boolean value then negates it
  * Increment (++):	Adds one to its operand
  * Decrement (--):	Decrements by one from its operand
  * Bitwise not (~):	Inverts all the bits in the operand and returns a number
  * typeof:	Returns a string which is the type of the operand
  * delete:	Deletes specific index of an array or specific property of an object
  * void:	Discards a return value of an expression.
