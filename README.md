**Unary & Binary Operators**  
Mathematically, an operation is a calculation on one or more values called operands mapping to an output value. An operator is a symbol/sign that maps operands to output values.  

* **A unary operator is one that takes a single operand/argument and performs an operation.**
  * Unary plus (+):	Tries to convert the operand into a number
  * Unary negation (-):	Tries to convert the operand into a number and negates after
  * Logical Not (!):	Converts to boolean value then negates it
  * Increment (++):	Adds one to its operand
  * Decrement (--):	Decrements by one from its operand
  * Bitwise not (~):	Inverts all the bits in the operand and returns a number
  * typeof:	Returns a string which is the type of the operand
  * delete:	Deletes specific index of an array or specific property of an object
  * void:	Discards a return value of an expression.

* **A binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands and manipulates them to return a result.**
Some common binary operators in computing include:
 * Equal (==)
 * Not equal (!=)
 * Less than (<)
 * Greater than (>)
 * Greater than or equal to (>=)
 * Less than or equal to (<=)
 * Logical AND (&&)
 * Logical OR (||)
 * Plus (+)
 * Minus (-)
 * Multiplication (*)
 * Divide (/)
 
 
## Learning Objective 
* To understand what unary & Binary operators are
* To learn about primitive methods
